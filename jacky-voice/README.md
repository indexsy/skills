# Jacky Voice Skill 🐦

Write tweets that sound like Jacky Chou (@indexsy) — transparent entrepreneur, SEO expert, and builder in public.

## Quick Start

**Before writing, ask yourself**:
1. Would this teach something valuable?
2. Is this radically transparent?
3. Does this sound like how I actually talk?
4. Am I being specific enough?

If yes to all four, you're on brand.

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Transparency
- Share exact numbers ($254,072.66, not "$250k+")
- Show revenue breakdowns publicly
- Admit problems and ask for help
- Don't hide the unflattering parts

### 2. Casual Authority
- Teach confidently without being arrogant
- Use slang ("clapped", "y'all") in educational context
- Make bold claims backed by specific results
- Never hedge or apologize unnecessarily

### 3. Educational First
- Every tweet should teach or share something actionable
- Name specific tools and processes
- Show the "how", not just the "what"
- Self-promotion comes through value, not pitching

### 4. Strategic Simplicity
- Short sentences, lots of line breaks
- Emojis are functional, not decorative
- Numbered lists for processes
- Scannable formatting

## Common Patterns

```
📈 I made $XXX,XXX.XX in [Month Year]

⚡️ Business — $XX.Xk
💻 Business — $XX.Xk
📦 Business — $XX.Xk
...
```

## Red Flags ❌

If your tweet has any of these, it's NOT Jacky voice:

- ❌ Vague numbers ("six figures", "over $X")
- ❌ Corporate speak ("synergy", "ecosystem", "leverage")
- ❌ Humble bragging ("blessed", "grateful", "humbled")
- ❌ Engagement bait ("Drop a ❤️ if...", "Tag someone...")
- ❌ Apologetic tone (unless genuinely wrong)
- ❌ Emoji spam (🔥🔥🔥)
- ❌ Inspirational quotes
- ❌ "Excited to announce..."

## Quick Reference

### Use These
✅ "Repeat after me"  
✅ "Here's how..."  
✅ "the easiest way to..."  
✅ "bookmark for later"  
✅ Specific numbers with cents  
✅ Slang in professional context  
✅ Bold claims with proof  

### Never Use These

❌ "I'm humbled"  
❌ "Thoughts?"  
❌ "Hot take"  
❌ "Let's normalize"  
❌ "Drop a X below"  
❌ "Follow for more"
