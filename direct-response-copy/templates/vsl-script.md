## VSL Best Practices

### Delivery

- Text on screen reinforces key points
- Show proof (screenshots, testimonials)
- Progress indicator keeps viewers engaged

### Length Guidelines
- Lead magnet VSL: 5-10 minutes
- Low ticket ($100-500): 10-20 minutes
- Mid ticket ($500-2000): 20-35 minutes
- High ticket ($2000+): 30-60 minutes

### What to Test
1. The hook (first 30 seconds = most important)
2. Different story angles
3. Offer presentation order
4. CTA placement and language
