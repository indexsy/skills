## Landing Page Design Principles

1. **One CTA** — Same action, repeated multiple times
2. **F-pattern reading** — Important stuff on left
3. **Above the fold** — Value prop visible without scrolling
4. **Visual hierarchy** — Headlines > subheads > body
5. **Whitespace** — Elements need room to breathe
6. **Mobile-first** — 60%+ of traffic is mobile
7. **Minimal navigation** — Don't give them exit options
8. **Consistent styling** — Same button color throughout
