## Facebook/Instagram Ads

### 1. Direct Response — Problem-Agitate-Solve

**Hook:** "I wasted $10,000 on ads before I learned this..."

```
I wasted $10,000 on Facebook ads before I learned this...

The problem wasn't my targeting.
It wasn't my budget.
It wasn't even my offer.

It was my creative.

I was testing ONE ad at a time when I should've been testing 10.

Now I test 10-20 creatives per week.

Result? My ROAS went from 1.2x to 4.7x in 90 days.

Want to see the exact framework I use?

I put together a free guide: "The Creative Testing System"

```

**Why it works:**
- Personal failure hook (relatable)
- Specific numbers ($10K, 1.2x → 4.7x)
- Problem → insight → solution
- Free lead magnet

### 2. Social Proof — Results Ad

**Hook:** "From $3K/mo to $47K/mo in 6 months"

```
From $3K/mo to $47K/mo in 6 months.

That's what happened when Sarah implemented our system.

❌ Before: Guessing which ads would work
✅ After: Predictable system that scales

Here's what she said:

"I finally feel like I understand what makes an ad work. The framework changed everything."

### 3. Curiosity Gap — "If-Then" Ad

**Hook:** "If you're spending $1,000+ on ads..."

```
If you're spending $1,000+/month on ads and NOT seeing at least 3x ROAS...

You're probably making one of these 3 mistakes:

1. Testing too few creatives
2. Wrong audience selection
3. Broken funnel economics

The good news? All 3 are fixable.

I made a free checklist that shows you exactly what to fix.

**Why it works:**

- Specific threshold ($1K, 3x)

### 4. Story Ad — Before/After

**Hook:** "2 years ago, I was about to give up..."

```
2 years ago, I was about to give up.

My agency had 3 clients.
I was working 60 hours a week.
Making less than I did at my old job.

Then I discovered one thing that changed everything:

Productized services.

Instead of custom projects, I created one repeatable offer.

Fast forward to today:
→ 47 clients
→ 30 hours/week
→ Multiple 6 figures

Want to see how I structured it?

### 5. Listicle Ad — Quick Value

```
5 Landing Page Mistakes Killing Your Conversions:

1. Too many CTAs (stick to one)
2. Vague headline (be specific about the benefit)
3. No social proof above the fold
4. Long forms (only ask what you need)
5. No mobile optimization (60% of traffic)

Fix these and watch your conversion rate climb.

### 10. LinkedIn — Thought Leadership

```
Hot take: The best marketers don't A/B test.

They A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J test.

Testing one thing at a time is too slow.

Here's what top performers do instead:

→ Test 10+ creatives per week
→ Kill losers fast (24-48 hours)
→ Scale winners immediately
→ Iterate on patterns, not guesses

The volume of tests matters more than the quality of any single test.

Agree or disagree? 👇
```

**Why it works:**
- Contrarian hook
- Specific framework
- Actionable takeaways
- Engagement prompt

## Twitter/X Ads

### 11. Twitter — Short & Punchy

```
99% of landing pages fail because the headline 
doesn't answer one question:

"What's in it for me?"

If your headline doesn't pass this test, 
nothing else matters.
```

**Why it works:**
- Stat hook (99%)
- Simple framework
- Easy to understand
- Shareable insight

---

### 12. Twitter Thread — Educational

```
