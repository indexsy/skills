Video Sales Letter frameworks and examples.

## What Is a VSL?

A Video Sales Letter (VSL) is a sales page in video format. It follows the same principles as written sales copy but leverages:
- Voice for emotional impact
- Visuals for engagement
- Pacing for retention

**When to use a VSL:**
- High-ticket offers ($500+)
- Complex products that need explanation
- Personal brand/coaching offers
- When your audience prefers video

---

## The Classic VSL Framework (PASTOR)

### P — Problem

**Goal:** Get viewers nodding "yes, that's me"

```
SCRIPT:

"Have you ever [specific frustrating experience]?

You know that feeling when [emotional description of problem]...

And no matter what you try—[solution they've tried 1], 
[solution they've tried 2], [solution they've tried 3]—
nothing seems to work?

If that sounds familiar, I have something important 
to share with you.

But first, let me ask..."
```

**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

---

### A — Amplify

**Goal:** Make the pain feel urgent

```
SCRIPT:

"Here's what happens if you don't solve this:

[Negative consequence 1]
[Negative consequence 2]
[Negative consequence 3]

And the worst part?

Every day you wait, [escalating consequence].

I know because I was in the exact same spot [timeframe] ago..."
```

**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

---

### S — Story

**Goal:** Build connection through narrative

```
SCRIPT:

"[Personal story or customer story]

When I was [situation], I struggled with [same problem].

I tried [what didn't work].
I spent [money/time/effort] on [failed solutions].
I was about to [give up / accept failure].

Then [discovery moment].

That's when I realized [key insight].

And that changed everything."
```

**Duration:** 2-4 minutes

---

### T — Transformation

**Goal:** Paint the after picture

```
SCRIPT:

"Within [timeframe], [transformation result].

Specifically:
- [Specific result 1]
- [Specific result 2]
- [Specific result 3]

But I'm not special. The same thing happened for [customer examples]:

[Testimonial 1]
[Testimonial 2]

And it can happen for you too."
```

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

---

### O — Offer

**Goal:** Present everything they get

```
SCRIPT:

"That's why I created [Product Name].

Here's exactly what you get:

Component 1: [Name]
[Description of what it is and what it does for them]

Component 2: [Name]
[Description]

Component 3: [Name]
[Description]

But that's not all.

When you join today, you also get:

Bonus 1: [Name] ($X value)
Bonus 2: [Name] ($X value)
Bonus 3: [Name] ($X value)

Total value: $[Large Number]

But you won't pay anywhere near that.

Your investment today is just $[Price]."
```

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

---

### R — Response

**Goal:** Close the sale with clear CTA

```
SCRIPT:

"Here's what to do next:

**[INTRO — 0:00-0:30]**

[Text on screen: "Why Most Landing Pages Don't Convert (And How to Fix It)"]

"If your landing pages aren't converting...

If you've tried tweaking your headlines, testing buttons, 
and even hiring copywriters...

And nothing seems to move the needle...

Then what I'm about to share might change everything.

My name is [Name], and in the next few minutes, 
I'm going to show you the exact framework 
I've used to write landing pages that convert 
at 2-3x the industry average."

---

**[PROBLEM — 0:30-2:00]**

"Here's the thing about landing pages:

Most people approach them completely wrong.

They think it's about the design.
Or the button color.
Or the headline formula.

So they read 10 blog posts about 'best practices'...
They copy what their competitors are doing...
They A/B test tiny details that don't matter...

And they end up with a page that looks good 
but doesn't convert.

Sound familiar?

I know because I was there too."

---

**[AGITATE — 2:00-3:30]**

"And here's what happens when your landing pages don't convert:

Every dollar you spend on ads gets wasted.
Every piece of content you create leads nowhere.
Every visitor bounces and never comes back.

You're literally paying to send people 
to a page that doesn't work.

And every day you let this continue,
you're leaving money on the table.

$10... $100... $1,000... every single day.

The math is brutal."

---

**[STORY — 3:30-7:00]**

"Three years ago, I was running an agency.

We were getting traffic—lots of it.
But conversions were terrible.

I hired 'expert' copywriters. Expensive.
I bought every course on conversion optimization.
I tested hundreds of variations.

Nothing worked.

I was about to shut down the agency when 
I discovered something that changed everything.

I was reading an old copywriting book from the 1960s...

And I realized that modern marketing had forgotten
the fundamentals that actually make people buy.

It wasn't about tricks. It wasn't about tactics.

It was about understanding the psychology of decision-making
and structuring your page to match how people actually think.

So I rebuilt my landing page framework from scratch.

Based on psychology, not 'best practices.'

The first page I rewrote? Conversion rate went from 1.8% to 7.2%.

That's a 4x improvement.

I rewrote another. Same thing.
And another. Same results.

That's when I knew I was onto something."

---

**[SOCIAL PROOF — 7:00-9:00]**

"Since then, I've helped hundreds of businesses 
transform their landing pages.

Here's what they've experienced:

[Name] increased her conversion rate from 2.1% to 8.7%
That translated to $127,000 in additional revenue—
from the same traffic she was already getting.

[Name] used the framework to launch his course.
Sold $43,000 in the first week.

[Name] optimized her SaaS trial page.
Trial sign-ups went up 340%.

The results speak for themselves.

And now I want to share this framework with you."

## VSL Best Practices

### Pacing
- Start slow (build trust)
- Speed up during story (build momentum)
- Slow down for offer (ensure comprehension)
- Fast close (urgency)

### Visuals
- Text on screen reinforces key points
- Slides > talking head for longer VSLs
- Show proof (screenshots, testimonials)
- Progress bar keeps viewers watching

### Voice
- Conversational, not scripted-sounding
- Vary energy levels
- Pause for emphasis
- Sound like you're talking to one person

### Length
- Lead magnet VSL: 5-10 minutes
- Low-ticket ($100-500): 10-20 minutes
- Mid-ticket ($500-2000): 20-35 minutes
- High-ticket ($2000+): 30-60 minutes

### Testing
- Test hooks (first 30 seconds determine everything)
- Test different story angles
- Test offer presentations
- Test CTA placement and timing
