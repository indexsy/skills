   (Use this for every email you write)

The whole guide is 45 pages, but those two chapters 
will give you the biggest bang for your time.

Over the next few days, I'll share some bonus tips

### 4. Morning Brew — Story-Driven Value

**Subject:** The $1.4B mistake airlines keep making

which seats to sell at which prices.

Here's what happened:

The lesson? The best algorithms still need human oversight.

That's why the smartest companies are building 
"human-in-the-loop" AI systems.

More on this tomorrow.

and they can sign up here.
```

**Why it works:**
