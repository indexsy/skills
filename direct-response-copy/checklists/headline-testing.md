## Evaluation Criteria

For each headline candidate, ask:

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Can I understand the value in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Would someone unfamiliar know what this is about?

**Benefit:**
- [ ] Is there a clear "what's in it for me"?
- [ ] Does it speak to a DESIRE or solve a PAIN?

**Specificity:**
- [ ] Are there specific numbers, results, or timeframes?
- [ ] Does it avoid vague words like "better," "easier," "more"?

**Believability:**
- [ ] Does it sound plausible (not too hype-y)?
- [ ] Would a skeptic believe it?

**Curiosity:**
- [ ] Does it make me want to read more?
- [ ] Is there an unanswered question?

**Audience Fit:**
- [ ] Does it speak to MY specific audience?
- [ ] Would my target customer see themselves in it?

## Headline Red Flags

Watch out for these warning signs:

- [ ] **Too vague:** "Improve your business" (improve how? which business?)
- [ ] **Too clever:** Puns or wordplay that sacrifices clarity
- [ ] **Too long:** Over 15 words (hard to scan)
- [ ] **Too hypey:** "Revolutionary" "Game-changing" "Breakthrough"
- [ ] **Features-only:** "128-bit encryption" (so what?)
- [ ] **Me-focused:** "We're excited to announce..." (nobody cares)
- [ ] **Clickbait:** Promise more than the content delivers

## Testing Methods

### Quick Tests (Before Publishing)

**The 5-Second Test:**
Show headline to someone unfamiliar for 5 seconds.
Ask: "What is this offering and who is it for?"
If they can't answer, revise.

**The "Would I Click?" Test:**
Imagine seeing this in your feed among 10 other posts.
Ask: "Would I stop scrolling and click?"
If no, revise.

**The "So What?" Test:**
Read the headline out loud.
Ask: "So what? Why should I care?"
If there's no clear answer, revise.

### A/B Tests (After Publishing)

**What to test:**
- Different benefits in headline
- Question vs. statement
- Number vs. no number
- Short vs. long

**Sample size needed:**
- Minimum 100 impressions per variation
- Ideally 500+ for statistical significance
- Run for at least 48 hours

**What to measure:**
- Click-through rate (primary)
- Time on page (secondary)
- Conversion rate (ultimate)

## Headline Improvement Tactics

If your headline isn't working, try:

1. **Add specificity:**
   "Grow your email list" → "Grow your email list to 10,000 in 90 days"

2. **Add urgency:**
   "Learn copywriting" → "Learn copywriting before your competitors do"

3. **Address an objection:**
   "Get fit" → "Get fit without giving up your favorite foods"

4. **Make it personal:**
   "How to improve sales" → "How to improve YOUR sales this quarter"

5. **Add proof:**
   "Increase conversions" → "Increase conversions 47% (like 500+ others)"

6. **Create a curiosity gap:**
   "SEO tips" → "The SEO trick I learned that doubled my traffic"
