## Quick Pre-Flight

Before you hit publish, ask yourself:

1. **Is it clear?** Can someone understand the value in 5 seconds?
2. **Is it specific?** Are there concrete numbers, timeframes, results?
3. **Is it believable?** Does it feel too good to be true?
4. **Is there proof?** Do I have evidence this works?
5. **Is there risk reversal?** What if they're not satisfied?
6. **Is there ONE clear action?** Do they know what to do next?

If you answered "yes" to all six, you're ready to ship.
