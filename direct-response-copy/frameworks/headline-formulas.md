# Headline Formulas

> "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy." — David Ogilvy

## Why Headlines Matter

Your headline has one job: **get them to read the next line.**

- 8 out of 10 people will read your headline
- Only 2 out of 10 will read the rest
- A great headline can increase response by 10x
- Always write 25+ headline variations before choosing

## The 4 U's Framework

Every headline should score high on at least 3 of these:

| U | Question | Example Upgrade |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| **Useful** | Does it promise a clear benefit? | "Save Money" → "Cut Your Bills by 40%" |
| **Ultra-specific** | Does it use numbers/details? | "Increase Sales" → "Increase Sales 127% in 90 Days" |
| **Urgent** | Is there a reason to act now? | "Learn SEO" → "Stop Losing Traffic: Learn SEO This Week" |
| **Unique** | Is this different from competitors? | "Get Fit" → "Get Fit Without a Gym or Equipment" |
