# Offer Construction Framework

> "You can have the best copy in the world, but if the offer stinks, it won't convert." — Dan Kennedy

## What Is an Offer?

An offer is **everything the customer gets when they say yes**—not just the product, but the complete package of value, bonuses, guarantees, and terms.

**A great offer includes:**
- The core product/service
- Bonuses that increase perceived value
- A guarantee that removes risk
- Urgency or scarcity (when real)
- Clear terms (what they pay, what they get, when)

**The Offer Hierarchy:**
1. Best offer + weak copy = can still convert
2. Strong copy + weak offer = struggles
3. Strong copy + strong offer = unstoppable

## The Value Stacking Formula

Value stacking shows customers they're getting way more value than they're paying for.

### The Basic Value Stack Structure

```
CORE OFFER: [Main Product] .................. $X,XXX Value

BONUS 1: [Fast-Action Bonus] ................ $XXX Value
BONUS 2: [Complementary Tool/Resource] ...... $XXX Value  
BONUS 3: [Access/Community] ................. $XXX Value
BONUS 4: [Support/Implementation] ........... $XXX Value

TOTAL VALUE: $XX,XXX

YOUR PRICE TODAY: $XXX

GUARANTEE: [Risk Reversal]
```

### Rules for Effective Value Stacking

1. **Bonuses must be relevant** — They should help the customer succeed with the core offer
2. **Values must be believable** — Don't inflate ridiculously
3. **Anchor with the total first** — Show the full value before revealing the price
4. **Make bonuses tangible** — Specific deliverables, not vague promises

## Pricing Psychology

### Price Anchoring

Show a higher price first to make your price feel reasonable.

**Techniques:**
1. **Compare to alternatives:** "Agencies charge $5,000/mo for this—do it yourself for $79"
2. **Compare to cost of problem:** "How much is a lost customer worth? $500? $5,000?"
3. **Compare to individual components:** "Separately, these would cost $2,088"
4. **Compare to previous price:** "Usually $997, today $497"

### Charm Pricing

Prices ending in 7, 9, or 95 feel more like deals.

| Original | Charm Price |
|----------|-------------|
| $100 | $97 |
| $50 | $47 |
| $500 | $497 |
| $1000 | $997 |

### Payment Plans

Reduce friction by breaking large amounts into smaller payments.

```
ONE-TIME PAYMENT: $497 (Best Value - Save $34)
— or —
3 MONTHLY PAYMENTS: $177/month
```

**Rule:** Monthly total should be slightly more than one-time (incentivizes full payment) but not so much it feels punitive.

### The 10x Rule

Your offer should deliver **10x the value** of the price.

- If you charge $500, customer should get $5,000+ in value
- If you charge $5,000, customer should get $50,000+ in value

This is the "no-brainer threshold"—when the value is so obviously greater than the price that saying no feels foolish.

## Guarantee Types

A strong guarantee removes the fear of making a wrong decision.

### 1. Money-Back Guarantee

```

## Urgency & Scarcity

Urgency and scarcity work because of **loss aversion**—people fear missing out more than they desire gaining.

### Legitimate Urgency Tactics

| Type | Example | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Deadline** | "Offer ends Friday at midnight" | Limited-time promotions |
| **Limited quantity** | "Only 50 spots available" | Cohort-based or capacity-limited |
| **Rising price** | "Price goes up $100 on Monday" | Launch sequences |
| **Bonus expiration** | "Bonuses disappear in 48 hours" | Launch incentives |
| **Seasonal** | "Black Friday pricing—this week only" | Holiday sales |
| **Cart expiration** | "Your cart will expire in 24 hours" | Cart abandonment |

### How to Write Urgency Copy

```
WHY YOU SHOULD ACT NOW:

[Reason the deadline/limit exists]

After [deadline]:
❌ [What they'll lose - bonus 1]
❌ [What they'll lose - bonus 2]
❌ [Price increase / doors close]

Don't wait. [CTA]
```

### Example Urgency Block

```
⏰ THIS OFFER EXPIRES IN:
[Countdown Timer]

After the timer hits zero:
• The $497 price goes back to $997
• The bonus templates disappear
• The early-bird coaching calls are gone

This is the lowest price [Product] will ever be.

```

### ⚠️ Warning: Never Fake Urgency

Fake urgency destroys trust:
- Countdown timers that reset
- "Limited spots" that are never limited
- "Sale ends today" that runs forever

**Rule:** Only use urgency that's real. If you say it ends Friday, it ends Friday.

## Offer Testing Framework

### What to Test (In Order of Impact)

1. **Price point** — $97 vs $197 vs $297
2. **Guarantee** — 30 day vs 60 day vs lifetime
3. **Bonuses** — Which bonuses increase conversions?
4. **Payment options** — One-time vs payment plan vs both
5. **Urgency elements** — With deadline vs without

### How to Test

1. Run A/B tests with significant traffic
2. Test one variable at a time
3. Run until statistical significance
4. Document winners and losers
