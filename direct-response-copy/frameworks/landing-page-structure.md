# Landing Page Structure

> "Every element on your landing page should move the visitor toward one action. If it doesn't, delete it."

## The Purpose of a Landing Page

A landing page exists to convert visitors into leads or customers through **one focused action**.

Unlike homepages (which serve many purposes), landing pages have a singular mission:
- Sign up for trial
- Book a demo
- Buy the product
- Join the waitlist
- Download a resource

**One goal. One CTA. One path.**

## Landing Page Length by Awareness Level

| Awareness Level | Ideal Length | Key Sections |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Most Aware | Short (under 500 words) | Hero, Offer, CTA |
| Product Aware | Medium (500-1000 words) | Hero, Differentiation, Proof, Offer, CTA |
| Solution Aware | Medium-Long (1000-2000 words) | Hero, Mechanism, Features, Proof, Offer, CTA |
| Problem Aware | Long (2000-4000 words) | Hero, Problem, Agitate, Solution, Proof, Offer, CTA |
| Unaware | Very Long (4000+ words) | Story-driven with full education |

**Rule of thumb:** The less they know, the more you need to educate. Cold traffic needs longer pages.

## The Universal Landing Page Framework

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)

The most important real estate on your page. Visitors decide in 3-5 seconds whether to stay.

**Components:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo]                              [Nav: minimal]     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│  HEADLINE (clear value proposition)                     │
│                                                         │
│  Subheadline (who it's for + key benefit)              │
│                                                         │
│  [PRIMARY CTA BUTTON]                                   │
│                                                         │
│  "Trusted by 5,000+ companies" + [Logo bar]            │
│                                                         │
│  [Hero Image/Video/Demo]                               │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Hero Headline Formula:**
```
[End Result Customer Wants] + [Time Period] + [Address Objection]

Examples:
- "Get More Qualified Leads in 30 Days—Without Paid Ads"
- "Build Landing Pages That Convert in Minutes, Not Days"
- "Master Spanish in 90 Days—Even If You've Failed Before"
```

**Hero Subheadline Formula:**
```
[Target Audience] use [Product Name] to [Primary Benefit] so they can [Desired Outcome]

Example:
"Marketers use LocalRank to track local search rankings so they can prove ROI to clients."
```

### Section 2: Social Proof Bar

Immediately reduce skepticism with quick proof.

**Options:**
- Logo bar: "Trusted by teams at [logos]"
- Stats: "10,000+ users | 4.8/5 on G2 | 99.9% uptime"
- Press: "Featured in [publication logos]"
- Results: "$47M+ revenue generated for clients"

### Section 3: Problem Agitation

Make them feel the pain they're already experiencing.

**Structure:**
```
[Open with relatable problem statement]

You've tried [common solution 1], but [why it fails].
You've tried [common solution 2], but [why it fails].
You've tried [common solution 3], but [why it fails].

Meanwhile, [negative consequence of not solving].
[Another negative consequence].
[Future threat if nothing changes].

Sound familiar?
```

**Example for BrowserBlast:**
```
You've published great content. You've done the keyword research.
You've built the links. But Google still won't index your pages.

You've tried submitting to Search Console manually.
You've tried pinging services.
You've tried waiting patiently.

And still... your pages sit in limbo while competitors rank.

Every day your content isn't indexed is a day you're losing traffic,
leads, and revenue to someone else.
```

### Section 4: Solution Introduction

Present your product as the bridge from pain to desired outcome.

**Structure:**
```
[Transition from problem]

Introducing [Product]: The [category] that [key differentiator].

Unlike [competitors/alternatives], [Product] uses [unique mechanism]
to [achieve result] in [timeframe].

[Brief overview of how it works]
```

**Keep it high-level here.** You'll go deeper in the features section.

### Section 5: How It Works

Simplify your process into 3 steps (occasionally 4, never more than 5).

**Format:**
```
How [Product] Works:

1. [Action] → [Immediate result]
   "Connect your Search Console in 60 seconds"

2. [Action] → [Immediate result]  
   "Add the URLs you want indexed"

3. [Action] → [Immediate result]
   "Watch as pages get indexed within hours"
```

**Visual:** Include icons or screenshots for each step.

### Section 6: Features → Benefits → Outcomes

Don't just list features. Connect each to what it means for the user.

**Format:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Feature Icon]                                         │
│                                                         │
│  Feature: Automated Indexing Requests                   │
│  Benefit: Never manually submit to Search Console again │
│  Outcome: Spend time on strategy, not tedious tasks     │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Feature copy formula:**
- Feature: What it IS
- Benefit: What it DOES for you
- Outcome: How your LIFE changes

Present 3-6 key features, prioritized by what matters most to your audience.

### Section 7: Social Proof (Deep)

Go deeper than the logo bar. Show transformation.

**Types of social proof:**
1. **Testimonials with results:**
   ```

   ```

2. **Case studies:**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

   │                                                         │

   │  Solution: Implemented BrowserBlast's bulk indexing     │
   │  Result: 94% of pages indexed within 30 days           │
   │         → 47% increase in organic traffic              │
   │                                                         │
   │  [Read Full Case Study →]                               │

3. **Video testimonials:** 30-60 seconds from real customers

4. **Review aggregators:** G2, Capterra, TrustPilot widgets

5. **Usage stats:** "Processed 5M+ indexing requests"

## Landing Page Copy Best Practices

### Writing Style

1. **Write in second person:** "You" and "Your" (not "We" and "Our")
2. **Keep sentences short:** Under 20 words
3. **Keep paragraphs short:** 2-3 sentences max
4. **Use subheads:** Allow skimming
5. **Active voice:** "BrowserBlast indexes your pages" not "Your pages are indexed"
6. **Conversational tone:** Write like you talk

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **One CTA style:** Same color, same text throughout
2. **F-pattern reading:** Important info on left
3. **Whitespace:** Give elements room to breathe
4. **Contrast:** CTA buttons should stand out
5. **Mobile-first:** Most traffic is mobile

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Multiple CTAs competing for attention
❌ Walls of text without breaks
❌ Stock photos instead of real product shots
❌ Vague headlines ("Welcome to our website")
❌ Features without benefits
❌ No social proof
❌ Buried or unclear pricing
❌ No risk reversal
