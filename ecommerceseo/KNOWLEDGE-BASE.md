# eCommerce SEO Audit + SOP Knowledge Base (for LLMs)

**Purpose:** Provide a repeatable, agency-grade process for auditing and improving **eCommerce SEO rankings** across product, collection, and informational pages, with implementation steps, prioritization rules, deliverable formats, and tooling guidance.

**Voice guidelines:** Clear, practical, non-hype. Avoid guarantees. Focus on diagnosis → prioritization → execution. Mention tools only when they remove manual work or reduce error rates.

---

## 1) What eCommerce SEO Optimizes

eCommerce SEO focuses on three page types with distinct intent:

* **Transactional pages** (Products + Collections) — High purchase intent
* **Informational pages** (Blog + Guides) — Top-of-funnel awareness
* **Navigational pages** (Homepage + Categories) — Brand + category discovery

Google is currently prioritizing eCommerce stores in search. The key is matching page type to search intent.

## 2) MVP eCommerce SEO Framework

Using hiking boots as an example:

1. **Homepage** targets "waterproof hiking boots" (broad category)
2. **Collection pages** target "hiking boots for men" (category + modifier)
3. **Product pages** target "brown hiking boots for men" (specific product)
4. **Blog** targets "best hiking boots for x" + informational keywords
5. **Build quality backlinks** (authority + trust)
6. **Fast site** (use Shopify, minimize apps)
7. **Interlink** blogs → collections → products (hub-and-spoke)
8. ???
9. Profit 💰💰

## 10) Decision Trees

### Page Type → Keyword Intent

```
IF intent == "buy [product]" or "[product] price":
  → Product page

IF intent == "[category] for [modifier]" or "best [category]":
  → Collection page (if product listing)
  → Blog post (if comparison/guide)

IF intent == "how to [topic]" or "what is [topic]":
  → Blog post / Guide

IF intent == "[brand name]":
  → Homepage
```

### Duplicate Content Handling

```
IF product variants (color, size):
  → Canonical to main product
  → OR use variant schema

IF filtered collection URLs:
  → Option 1: Noindex filtered pages
  → Option 2: Canonical to main collection
  → Option 3: Block in robots.txt

IF paginated collections:
  → Ensure all pages are crawlable
  → OR implement view-all page with canonical
```

### Out-of-Stock Products

```
IF temporarily out of stock:
  → Keep page live
  → Add "notify me" email capture
  → Update availability schema

IF permanently discontinued:
  → 301 redirect to:
    → Similar product (if exists)
    → Parent collection (if no similar)
    → Homepage (last resort)
```

---

## 11) Error Handling

```
IF site returns 5xx errors:
  → P0 Issue: "Server errors blocking crawling"
  → Fix: Check hosting, server logs

IF key pages return 404:
  → P0 Issue: "Important pages not found"
  → Fix: Restore or redirect

IF robots.txt blocks /collections/ or /products/:
  → P0 Issue: "Robots.txt blocking indexation"
  → Fix: Update robots.txt

IF no sitemap found:
  → P1 Issue: "XML sitemap missing"
  → Fix: Generate and submit

IF schema validation fails:
  → P2 Issue: "Invalid structured data"
  → Fix: Correct schema markup
```

## 14) Keyword Cannibalization Detection

**Method 1: Site Search**
```
site:[domain] "[target keyword]"
```
Multiple pages ranking for same keyword with same intent = Cannibalization

**Common Patterns:**

### Product vs Collection
```
Problem:
  /products/running-shoes → "running shoes"
  /collections/running-shoes → "running shoes"

Solution:
  Collection = broad term ("running shoes")
  Product = specific ("nike air max running shoes")
```

### Blog vs Commercial
```
Problem:
  /blog/best-running-shoes → "best running shoes"
  /collections/running-shoes → "best running shoes"

Solution:
  Blog = informational ("how to choose running shoes")
  Collection = transactional ("buy running shoes")
```

### Multiple Collections
```
Problem:
  /collections/mens-shoes
  /collections/mens-footwear
  /collections/shoes-for-men
  All targeting "mens shoes"

Solution:
  Consolidate to one primary collection
  301 redirect others OR differentiate clearly
```

**Detection Checklist:**
- [ ] Export all page titles and URLs
- [ ] Look for multiple pages with same target keyword in title
- [ ] Check overlapping H1 tags
- [ ] Search `site:[domain] "[keyword]"` for each target

---

## 15) Hub-and-Spoke Internal Linking Model

**Structure:**
```
       [COLLECTION PAGE]  ← Hub
        /     |      \
       /      |       \
   [Product] [Product] [Product]  ← Spokes
       \      |       /
        \     |      /
         [BLOG POST]  ← Spoke (links back to hub)
```

**Implementation:**

### Collection as Hub
- Links to top 10-20 products
- Links to related sub-collections
- Links to buying guide content
- Receives links from all spokes

### Products as Spokes
- Link back to parent collection
- Link to 4-6 related products
- Link to relevant guides/blog posts

### Blog Posts as Spokes
- Every post links to relevant products (2-3 minimum)
- Every post links to relevant collection
- Create "Related Articles" section on collection pages

**Cross-Linking Rules:**
```
Collection ↔ Collection: 3-5 related category links
Product ↔ Product: 4-6 related products ("You might also like")
Blog → Product/Collection: Every post links to 2-3+ products
Collection → Blog: Add "Related Guides" section
```

---

## 16) Faceted Navigation Handling

**Problem:** Filters create duplicate URLs
```
/shoes
/shoes?color=red
/shoes?color=red&size=10
/shoes?sort=price
```

**4 Solutions:**

### Option 1: Canonical Tags
All filtered URLs → canonical to main collection
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="/shoes" />
```
Best for: Most eCommerce sites

### Option 2: Block in robots.txt
```
Disallow: /*?color=
Disallow: /*?size=
Disallow: /*?sort=
Disallow: /*&
```
Best for: Large sites with crawl budget issues

### Option 3: AJAX Filters (No URL Change)
Filters don't create new URLs — JS updates content
Best for: New sites, sites with dev resources

### Option 4: URL Parameter Handling in GSC
Configure which parameters to ignore
Best for: Supplementary to other methods

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF crawl budget is concern → robots.txt block
IF already have many indexed filter URLs → canonical
IF building new site → AJAX filters
ALWAYS → configure GSC parameters as backup
```

---

## 17) Log File Analysis (Crawl Budget)

**Goal:** Optimize how Googlebot spends crawl budget

### Extract Googlebot Data
```bash
# Filter Googlebot requests
grep "Googlebot" access.log > googlebot.log

# Count total requests
grep -c "Googlebot" access.log

# Most crawled URLs
grep "Googlebot" access.log | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -50

# Find filter parameter waste
grep "Googlebot" access.log | grep "?" | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

### Crawl Budget Distribution
```
| Page Type     | % of Crawl | Priority | Status   |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Products      | 40-50%     | High     | GOOD     |
| Collections   | 20-30%     | High     | GOOD     |
| Homepage      | 5-10%      | Medium   | GOOD     |
| Blog          | 10-15%     | Medium   | GOOD     |
| Filters       | <5%        | Low      | OK       |
| Filters       | >10%       | Low      | WASTE    |
| Search/Cart   | Any        | None     | WASTE    |
```

### Common Crawl Waste (Fix Immediately)
1. **Faceted navigation** → Block in robots.txt
2. **Internal search results** → `Disallow: /search`
3. **Cart/checkout pages** → `Disallow: /cart`
4. **Session ID parameters** → Use cookies instead
5. **Sort parameters** → Canonical to default
