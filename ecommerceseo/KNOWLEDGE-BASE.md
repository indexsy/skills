# eCommerce SEO Audit + SOP Knowledge Base (for LLMs)

**Purpose:** Provide a repeatable, agency-grade process for auditing and improving **eCommerce SEO rankings** across product, collection, and informational pages, with implementation steps, prioritization rules, deliverable formats, and tooling guidance.

**Voice guidelines:** Clear, practical, non-hype. Avoid guarantees. Focus on diagnosis → prioritization → execution. Mention tools only when they remove manual work or reduce error rates.

## 1) What eCommerce SEO Optimizes

eCommerce SEO focuses on three page types with distinct intent:

* **Transactional pages** (Products + Collections) — High purchase intent
* **Informational pages** (Blog + Guides) — Top-of-funnel awareness
* **Navigational pages** (Homepage + Categories) — Brand + category discovery

Google is currently prioritizing eCommerce stores in search. The key is matching page type to search intent.

4. **Blog** targets "best hiking boots for x" + informational keywords
5. **Build quality backlinks** (authority + trust)
6. **Fast site** (use Shopify, minimize apps)
7. **Interlink** blogs → collections → products (hub-and-spoke)

## 10) Decision Trees

### Page Type → Keyword Intent

```
IF intent == "buy [product]" or "[product] price":
  → Product page

IF intent == "[category] for [modifier]" or "best [category]":
  → Collection page (if product listing)
  → Blog post (if comparison/guide)

IF intent == "how to [topic]" or "what is [topic]":
  → Blog post / Guide

IF intent == "[brand name]":
  → Homepage
```

### Duplicate Content Handling

```
IF product variants (color, size):
  → Canonical to main product
  → OR use variant schema

IF filtered collection URLs:
  → Option 1: Noindex filtered pages
  → Option 2: Canonical to main collection
  → Option 3: Block in robots.txt

IF paginated collections:
  → Ensure all pages are crawlable
  → OR implement view-all page with canonical
```

### Out-of-Stock Products

```
IF temporarily out of stock:
  → Keep page live
  → Add "notify me" email capture
  → Update availability schema

IF permanently discontinued:
  → 301 redirect to:
    → Similar product (if exists)
    → Parent collection (if no similar)
    → Homepage (last resort)
```

---

## 11) Error Handling

```
IF site returns 5xx errors:
  → P0 Issue: "Server errors blocking crawling"
  → Fix: Check hosting, server logs

IF key pages return 404:
  → P0 Issue: "Important pages not found"
  → Fix: Restore or redirect

IF robots.txt blocks /collections/ or /products/:
  → P0 Issue: "Robots.txt blocking indexation"
  → Fix: Update robots.txt

IF no sitemap found:
  → P1 Issue: "XML sitemap missing"
  → Fix: Generate and submit
