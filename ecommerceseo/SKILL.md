# eCommerce SEO Audit Skill

## Quick Start

**To run an eCommerce SEO audit, I need:**

1. **Store URL** (homepage)
2. **Platform** (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, etc.)
3. **Top 3-5 product categories** they want to rank for
4. **Target market** (US, UK, etc.)
5. **Main competitors** (2-3 URLs)

**Optional but helpful:**
- Google Search Console access
- Google Analytics access
- Current keyword targets
- Any past SEO work or issues

---

## What I'll Do

- Analyze site structure (homepage → collections → products → blog)
- Check technical SEO (indexation, speed, mobile, HTTPS)
- Audit on-page SEO (titles, metas, URLs, schema)
- Review content strategy (BOFU vs TOFU, cannibalization)
- Check internal linking structure
- Evaluate backlink profile vs competitors
- Produce full audit with prioritized issues (P0-P3)

## What I Can't Do (Needs Human Access)

- Make direct CMS changes
- Submit to Google Search Console
- Build backlinks (but can recommend strategy)
