## Scaling Method Selection

### When to Use Vertical Scaling (Budget Increase)

- [ ] CPA is 20%+ below target
- [ ] Frequency still low (<2.5)
- [ ] Haven't hit diminishing returns yet
- [ ] Single campaign/ad set to scale

**How:** Increase budget 20-30% every 2-3 days

### When to Use Horizontal Scaling (Duplication)

- [ ] Vertical scaling hitting diminishing returns
- [ ] Want to test audience variations
- [ ] Diversify risk across ad sets
- [ ] Campaign is mature

**How:** Duplicate winning ad set, change ONE variable

### When to Use Creative Scaling

- [ ] Performance limited by creative fatigue
- [ ] Want to scale without budget increase
- [ ] Testing phase identified multiple winners

**How:** Add new proven creative to existing ad sets

## Scaling Execution Checklist

### Vertical Scaling

- [ ] Calculate new budget (current × 1.2-1.3)
- [ ] Set budget increase time (early morning best)
- [ ] Set maximum budget cap
- [ ] Schedule check-in for 48 hours later
- [ ] Document the change

### Horizontal Scaling

- [ ] Select ad set to duplicate
- [ ] Choose ONE variable to change
- [ ] Set starting budget (same as original)
- [ ] Confirm no audience overlap issues
- [ ] Schedule check-in for 5 days later

---

## Post-Scale Monitoring

### First 48 Hours

- [ ] Spend is increasing as expected
- [ ] CPA holding (within 20% of pre-scale)
- [ ] No delivery issues
- [ ] Learning phase not reset

### Day 3-5

- [ ] CPA stabilizing
- [ ] No dramatic performance shifts
- [ ] Frequency still acceptable
- [ ] Decide: continue scaling or pause

### Day 7

- [ ] Full week data review
- [ ] CPA vs pre-scale comparison
- [ ] Ready for next scale increment?

---

## Warning Signs During Scale

### Stop Scaling If:

- [ ] CPA rises 30%+ and doesn't recover in 48 hours
- [ ] Frequency jumps above 3.5 (prospecting)
- [ ] CTR drops 30%+ week-over-week
- [ ] Algorithm enters learning phase
- [ ] Business capacity becomes an issue

### Recovery Actions:

| Problem | Action |
|---------|--------|
| CPA spike | Pause increases, wait, or reduce |
| High frequency | Add new creative or audiences |
| CTR drop | Refresh creative |
| Learning reset | Wait, don't make more changes |
