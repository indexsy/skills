## Scaling Prerequisites

### Before You Scale, Confirm:

- [ ] **CPA at or below target** for 5+ consecutive days
- [ ] **50+ conversions** with statistical confidence
- [ ] **CTR stable** (not declining)
- [ ] **Frequency under control** (<3 for prospecting)
- [ ] **Creative not fatigued** (still fresh)
- [ ] **Landing page stable** (no changes, good CVR)
- [ ] **Tracking working** (all events firing)

---

## Vertical Scaling (Budget Increases)

### Conservative Scaling

**When to Use:**
- CPA is close to target
- You're unsure how campaign will respond
- Learning phase just ended

**Method:**
```
Increase by 10-20% every 2-3 days

Day 1: $100
Day 3: $120 (+20%)
Day 5: $144 (+20%)
Day 7: $173 (+20%)
Day 10: $207 (+20%)
```

**Monitor:**
- CPA after each increase
- If CPA rises >20%, pause increases

### Moderate Scaling

**When to Use:**
- CPA is 20-30% below target
- Campaign has been stable for 1+ weeks
- Good conversion volume

**Method:**
```
Increase by 20-30% every 2-3 days

Day 1: $100
Day 3: $130 (+30%)
Day 5: $169 (+30%)
Day 7: $220 (+30%)
```

### Aggressive Scaling

**When to Use:**
- CPA is 50%+ below target
- You need to capture opportunity quickly
- Strong creative performing consistently

**Method:**
```
Increase by 50-100% if performance holds

Day 1: $100 (CPA: $15, target: $30)
Day 2: $200 (+100%)
Day 3: Monitor (still good?)
Day 4: $350 (+75%)
Day 5: Monitor
```

### Budget Increase Timing

**Best Time to Increase:**
- Early morning (12:00 AM - 2:00 AM your time)
- This is start of new day for the algorithm
- Budget for full day ahead

**Avoid:**
- Mid-day increases (disrupts pacing)
- Evening increases (partial day impact)

## Horizontal Scaling (Duplication)

### When to Duplicate

**Duplicate Instead of Budget Increase When:**
- Vertical scaling hitting diminishing returns
- CPA rises with budget increases
- You want to test audience variations
- Diversify risk across ad sets

### How to Duplicate

**Step 1: Choose What to Duplicate**
```
Best: Entire ad set (preserves learning)
Alternative: Just the ads
```

**Step 2: What to Change**
```
Change ONE thing:
- Different age range
- Different geography
- Different lookalike %
- Different placement focus
```

**Step 3: Budget**
```
Start duplicate at same budget as original
Let them compete
```

### Duplication Strategies

**Age Splits:**
```
Original: Broad 25-65
Duplicate 1: 25-40
Duplicate 2: 40-55
Duplicate 3: 55-65
```

**Geo Splits:**
```
Original: US All
Duplicate 1: US - CA, NY, TX
Duplicate 2: US - Other States
Duplicate 3: CA, UK, AU
```

**Lookalike Stacks:**
```
Original: 1% Customer LAL
Duplicate 1: 1% High-LTV LAL
Duplicate 2: 2% Customer LAL
Duplicate 3: Broad
```

### Managing Duplicates

**Watch for:**
- Audience overlap (competing with yourself)
- One duplicate dominating
- Combined frequency getting too high

**Pause duplicates when:**
- CPA is 50%+ above original
- CTR is significantly lower
- Clear underperformance after 5 days

## Creative Scaling

### Scale Winners, Not Just Budget

**Don't just increase budget** — also:
1. Create iterations of winning creative
2. Test new hooks with winning body
3. Test winning hook with new body
4. Test winning concept in new formats

### Creative Velocity at Scale

| Monthly Spend | New Creative/Week |
|---------------|-------------------|
| $20K | 10-15 |
| $50K | 15-25 |
| $100K | 25-40 |
| $200K+ | 40+ |

### Diversifying Creative

**Don't rely on one winner:**
```
Unhealthy: 80% of spend on 1 ad
Healthy: No ad >30% of spend
Best: 4-5 ads each at 15-25%
```

## Handling Scale Challenges

### CPA Rising During Scale

**Diagnosis:**
1. Is it gradual or sudden?
2. Is frequency rising?
3. Is CPM rising?
4. Is CTR falling?

**Solutions by Cause:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Creative fatigue | Add new creative |
| Audience saturation | Expand targeting |
| Competition | Accept higher CPA or pause |
| Quality decline | Improve creative |

### Algorithm Resets

**Signs of Reset:**
- "Learning" status reappeared
- Wild performance swings
- CPA significantly different

**What Triggers Resets:**
- Budget change >20% (sometimes)
- Targeting change (always)
- Creative change (if all ads changed)
- Pause >7 days (always)

**Recovery:**
- Wait 3-5 days
- Don't make more changes
- Let algorithm re-learn

### Diminishing Returns

**Signs:**
- Each budget increase yields smaller CPA improvement
- Eventually CPA starts rising
- Frequency increasing despite larger audience

**Response:**
1. Stop vertical scaling
2. Try horizontal scaling (duplicates)
3. Look for new winning creative
4. Accept current scale as efficient maximum

## Scale Planning

### Weekly Scale Review

```
1. What's current spend?
2. What's current CPA vs target?
3. Is there room to scale (CPA below target)?
4. What's limiting scale?
   - Budget → Increase budget
   - Creative → Need more creative
   - Audience → Need to expand
5. What's the plan for next week?
```

### Monthly Scale Goals

| Month | Spend | CPA Target | Actions |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | $10K | $30 | Test creative, find winners |
| 2 | $20K | $30 | Scale winners, test more |
| 3 | $35K | $28 | Horizontal scale, optimize |
| 4 | $50K | $27 | Sustain, iterate creative |

### Scale Limits

**Know Your Ceiling:**
- What's your total addressable market?
- At what CPA do you become unprofitable?
- What's your inventory/fulfillment capacity?
- What's your cash flow limit?
