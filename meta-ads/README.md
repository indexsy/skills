## Key Concepts

### The 3-Campaign Structure

1. **Testing (ABO)** — Test creatives, find winners with controlled budgets
2. **Scaling (CBO/Broad)** — Scale winners with broad targeting and CBO
3. **Retargeting** — Convert warm audiences with sequential messaging

### Creative Velocity

- Test 3-5 new creatives per week minimum
- Expect 10-20% winner rate
- Iterate on winners (same concept, new hooks)

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Hook Rate | >30% |
| Hold Rate | >15% |
| CTR | >1% |
| CPM | Industry dependent |
| CPA | Below target CAC |

## Quick Start

1. Read `SKILL.md` for the overview
2. Set up the 3-campaign structure using `campaigns/`
3. Create initial creatives using `creative/formats.md` and `creative/hooks.md`
4. Launch with `checklists/campaign-launch.md`
5. Optimize using `optimization/metrics.md`

## Usage

Use this skill when:
- Setting up new Meta ad campaigns
- Optimizing existing campaigns
- Creating ad creatives
- Scaling winning ads
- Troubleshooting performance issues
