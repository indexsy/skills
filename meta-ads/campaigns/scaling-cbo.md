## Purpose & Philosophy

### Why CBO for Scaling?

**The Problem with ABO at Scale:**
- You have to manually manage budget allocation
- Winner ad sets need more budget → manual adjustment
- Slow response to performance changes

**CBO Solution:**
- Meta automatically allocates budget to best performers
- 24/7 optimization without your intervention
- Faster reallocation than humans

### The Scaling Mindset

1. **Only proven winners enter** — No testing in scale
2. **Trust the algorithm** — CBO knows where to spend
3. **Scale gradually** — Big jumps reset learning
4. **Protect what works** — Don't touch winning ads

---

## Moving Winners from Testing

### Criteria for Graduation

**Minimum Requirements:**
- CPA at or below target for 3+ consecutive days
- 50+ conversions (100+ preferred)
- CTR above 0.8%
- No declining trend

**Ideal Winner Profile:**
- CPA 20%+ below target
- 100+ conversions
- CTR above 1.5%
- Stable or improving daily performance

### How to Move Ads

**Method 1: Duplicate Ad Set (Recommended)**
```
1. Go to winning ad set in Testing campaign
2. Click "Duplicate"
3. Select "Existing Campaign" → Scale campaign
4. Duplicate settings → Keep everything
5. Turn ON in scale campaign
6. Turn OFF in testing campaign (optional)
```

**Why Duplicate Ad Set:**
- Preserves optimization history
- Pixel learning transfers
- Cleaner than recreating

**Method 2: Duplicate Ad Only**
```
1. Go to winning ad
2. Click "Duplicate"  
3. Select existing ad set in Scale campaign
4. Add to existing winners
```

**Use When:**
- Adding variation to existing scale ad set
- Ad set structure different in scale

### Duplicate vs Create New

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Duplicate** | Always preferred — preserves learning |
| **Create New** | Only if duplicate isn't working |

### Post-Move Monitoring

**First 48 Hours:**
- Watch for delivery issues
- Ensure ad is spending
- Compare performance to testing

**If Performance Drops:**
- Give it 3-5 days (learning reset)
- If still poor after 5 days, investigate
- May need to duplicate fresh

## Broad Targeting in 2026

### Why Broad Works

**Meta's AI is Better Than Your Targeting**

| What You Think | What Algorithm Does |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Target 25-34 females interested in yoga" | Finds ALL people likely to convert |
| Limited to your hypothesis | Tests millions of signals |
| Based on assumptions | Based on conversion data |

**Broad Targeting = Let the Algorithm Do Its Job**

### When to Use Broad

**Use Broad When:**
- You have 50+ conversions/week
- Pixel has good data
- Creative is strong
- You want to scale

**Use Interests/Lookalikes When:**
- Very niche B2B (tiny market)
- Account is brand new
- You have <50 conversions/week
- You need to restrict (compliance/targeting)

### Setting Up Broad Targeting

**Broad Setup:**
```
Location: [Your target geography]
Age: 18-65+ (or 25-65+ if product is adult-focused)
Gender: All
Detailed Targeting: NONE
Advantage+ Audience: ON
```

**What Advantage+ Audience Does:**
Goes beyond your targeting to find additional converters. If you select some targeting, it uses that as a "suggestion" but expands.

### Geo Targeting Strategies

**Tier 1 Countries (Best Performance):**
- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia

**Tier 2 Countries (Good but Different):**
- Western Europe (Germany, France, Netherlands)
- Nordics (Sweden, Norway, Denmark)

**Strategy:**
- Start with Tier 1 only
- Test Tier 2 separately if Tier 1 saturates
- Never mix dramatically different geos in same ad set

### Age/Gender Restrictions

**Use Only When:**
- Product is legally restricted
- Very clear gender/age skew in buyers
- Policy requires it

**Example:**
- Alcohol → 21+ (legal requirement)
- Menstrual products → Female only (logical)
- General software → No restrictions (let algorithm decide)

## CBO Mastery

### How CBO Distributes Budget

```
Campaign Budget: $1,000/day

Meta evaluates hourly:
- Ad Set A: Converting at $20 CPA → Gets $500
- Ad Set B: Converting at $30 CPA → Gets $300  
- Ad Set C: Converting at $50 CPA → Gets $200

Next hour might shift based on real-time performance
```

### Minimum Spend Per Ad Set

**CBO Minimum Budget Rule:**
Each ad set must have minimum budget to be viable.

**Formula:**
```
Minimum per ad set = Target CPA × 10
```

**Example:**
- Target CPA: $30
- Minimum per ad set: $300
- With 3 ad sets: Campaign budget should be $900+

### Ad Set Spend Limits

**Set Minimum Spend Per Ad Set:**
Force CBO to give each ad set a fair chance.

**How to Set:**
1. Ad Set → Edit
2. Spending limits → Set minimum
3. Minimum = Target CPA × 3-5

**Example:**
```
Target CPA: $30
Minimum spend limit: $100/day
This ensures each ad set gets at least $100 to optimize
```

**When to Use:**
- New ad sets competing with established ones
- Testing new audiences in scale
- Ensuring winner diversity

### When CBO Fails

**CBO Underperforms When:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| One ad set gets all spend | Clear winner dominates | Add minimum spend limits |
| New ad sets get nothing | Established ads preferred | Duplicate to fresh campaign |
| Performance volatility | Too few ad sets | Add more proven winners |
| CPA rising | Winner fatigue | Refresh with new creative |

## Scaling Methods

### Vertical Scaling (Budget Increases)

**What It Is:**
Increasing budget on existing campaigns.

**The 20% Rule:**
Traditional advice: Don't increase more than 20% per day.

**Is 20% Still Valid in 2026?**
It depends:

| Situation | Can Exceed 20%? |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Learning complete, CPA stable | Yes, can go 30-50% |
| CPA significantly below target | Yes, can go 50%+ |
| Learning phase | No, stay conservative |
| CPA near target | No, stay at 20% |

**Conservative Scaling:**
```
Day 1: $100
Day 3: $120 (+20%)
Day 5: $144 (+20%)
Day 7: $173 (+20%)
Day 9: $207 (+20%)
Day 11: $249 (+20%)
```

**Aggressive Scaling (When CPA Way Below Target):**
```
Day 1: $100 (CPA: $15, target: $30)
Day 2: $200 (+100%)
Day 3: $200 (monitor)
Day 4: $400 (+100%) if CPA still good
```

**Budget Increase Timing:**
- Morning (12:00-1:00 AM) — Start of new day
- Avoid middle of day increases

### Horizontal Scaling (Duplication)

**What It Is:**
Creating duplicate ad sets with variations.

**When to Duplicate:**
- Vertical scaling hitting limits
- Want to test audience variations
- Want to spread risk

**How to Duplicate:**
```
1. Duplicate winning ad set
2. Change ONE thing:
   - Different age bracket
   - Different geo
   - Different lookalike %
3. Start at original budget
4. Let compete with original
```

**How Many Duplicates:**
- Start with 2-3
- Don't exceed 5-6 similar ad sets (internal competition)

**Audience Variations to Test:**
```
Original: Broad US, 25-65
Duplicate 1: Broad US, 25-45
Duplicate 2: Broad US, 45-65
Duplicate 3: Broad CA/UK/AU
Duplicate 4: 1% Lookalike
```

### Scaling with New Creatives

**The Safest Scale Method:**
Add new proven creative to existing scale campaign.

**Process:**
1. Test new creative in ABO testing campaign
2. Find winner
3. Add to existing winning ad set in scale
4. Budget stays same, creative variety increases

**Benefits:**
- No learning phase reset
- Creative diversity fights fatigue
- Algorithm finds best performer

### The Scaling Sequence

**Phase 1: Vertical First**
```
Start: $200/day
Week 1: Scale to $300-400/day
Week 2: Scale to $500-600/day
Watch: CPA stability
```

**Phase 2: Horizontal When Needed**
```
If CPA rises at $600/day:
- Don't push to $800
- Duplicate ad set instead
- 2 ad sets × $400 = $800 with better stability
```

**Phase 3: New Creative Always**
```
Continuously:
- Test new creative in ABO
- Add winners to scale
- Retire fatigued creative
```

## Handling Performance Fluctuations

### CPM Spikes

**Common Causes:**
- Increased competition (Black Friday, holidays)
- Audience saturation
- Quality score drop
- Policy issues

**Solutions:**
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Competition | Wait it out or adjust targets |
| Saturation | Broaden audience |
| Quality drop | Check ad relevance diagnostics |
| Policy | Review ads for violations |

### Performance Drops

**Diagnostic Process:**
```
1. Is CPM up? → Competition or quality issue
2. Is CTR down? → Creative fatigue
3. Is CVR down? → Landing page or offer issue
4. Is frequency high? → Audience saturation
```

**Troubleshooting Table:**
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Sudden CPA spike | Algorithm reset or competition | Wait 48h, then act |
| Gradual CPA rise | Creative fatigue | Add new creative |
| CTR declining | Ad fatigue | Refresh creative |
| High frequency (>3) | Audience saturation | Expand audience |
| CVR declining | Landing page issue | Test landing page |

### Creative Fatigue Signals

**Signs of Fatigue:**
- CTR declining week-over-week
- Frequency above 2.5-3.0
- CPA increasing while CPM stable
- Same creative running 3+ weeks

**Solutions:**
1. Add new creative to ad set
2. Pause fatigued ads
3. Create iterations of winning concept
4. Test completely new concepts

### When to Refresh vs Kill

**Refresh (Keep the Ad Set):**
- Ad set has good history
- Only 1-2 ads fatigued
- Other ads still performing
- Just add new creative

**Kill (Pause Entire Ad Set):**
- All ads fatigued
- Audience exhausted
- CPA 50%+ above target sustained
- Start fresh with new ad set

### Seasonal Adjustments

**High Competition Periods:**
- Q4 (Oct-Dec) — Holiday shopping
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday — Peak competition
- January — Post-holiday slump
- Summer — Variable by industry

**Adjustment Strategy:**
| Period | CPM Expectation | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Q4 | +30-100% | Increase CPA targets or scale back |
| Black Friday | +100-200% | Only run if ROAS covers |
| January | -20-30% | Good time to scale |
| Summer | Variable | Test aggressively |

## Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns

### What Is ASC?

Fully automated shopping campaign type:
- Meta controls all targeting
- AI tests creative combinations
- Automatic prospecting + retargeting
- Minimal inputs required

### How ASC Works

```
You Provide:
├── Creative assets (images, videos)
├── Product catalog (for ecom)
├── Budget
├── Country targeting
└── Existing customer budget cap

Meta Handles:
├── Audience targeting
├── Creative testing
├── Placement optimization
├── Budget distribution
└── Bid optimization
```

### When to Use ASC vs Manual

**Use ASC When:**
- Ecommerce with catalog
- 50+ purchases/week
- Strong creative library (10+ variations)
- You want simplicity

**Use Manual When:**
- B2B/lead gen (ASC is for shopping)
- Very specific targeting required
- Low conversion volume
- Testing creative (want control)

### ASC Setup Best Practices

**Existing Customer Budget Cap:**
- Set to 0-20% to focus on new customers
- If you want only prospecting, set 0%
- If you want balanced, set 10-20%

**Creative Requirements:**
- Minimum 5 ads, ideal 10+
- Mix of formats (video, static, carousel)
- Various angles and hooks
- Dynamic product ads included

**Country Targeting:**
- ASC operates at country level
- One ASC per country recommended
- Or group similar countries

### ASC Optimization

**What You Can Control:**
- Creative on/off
- Existing customer cap
- Budget
- Country

**What You Can't Control:**
- Detailed targeting
- Placements
- Bid strategy

**Optimization Levers:**
1. Add/remove creative
2. Adjust existing customer cap
3. Adjust budget
4. Test different countries

### ASC vs Manual Performance

**Typical Results:**
| Metric | ASC | Manual |
|--------|-----|--------|
| CPA | Often 10-20% lower | Baseline |
| Scale potential | High | Medium |
| Control | Low | High |
| Setup time | Minutes | Hours |

**When Manual Beats ASC:**
- Very niche audiences
- Specific retargeting sequences
- Limited creative assets
- When ASC isn't hitting targets
