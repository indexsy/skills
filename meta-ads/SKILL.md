```

**Key Rules:**
1. ABO for testing (you control budget per creative)
2. CBO for scaling (Meta optimizes among winners)
3. Never add untested creative directly to CBO
4. Kill losers fast in ABO

## The 2026 Meta Ads Reality

### What's Changed
- **Creative is the new targeting** — 70-80% of performance comes from creative quality
- **Broad targeting beats micro-targeting** — Meta's AI is smarter than your audience hypotheses
- **Advantage+ is the default** — Manual campaigns are for niche situations only
- **Video dominates** — Reels/short-form outperforms static by 50%+
- **CAPI is mandatory** — Pixel-only tracking misses 30-50% of conversions

### What Still Works
- Problem-agitate-solution copywriting
- Customer testimonials (most reliable creative format)
- Retargeting warm audiences
- First-party data (customer lists, website visitors)
- The two-campaign structure (ABO → CBO)

## When to Kill vs Scale an Ad

### Kill When (ABO Testing):
- CTR below 0.5% after 1,000+ impressions
- CPA 2x+ above target after 50+ conversions
- No conversions after spending 2x target CPA
- Frequency >3 with declining performance

### Graduate to CBO When:
- CPA at or below target for 3+ consecutive days
- 50+ conversions with statistical confidence
- CTR above 1% sustained
- Positive ROAS (if purchase optimization)

### Scale Aggressively When:
- CPA 50%+ below target
- ROAS 50%+ above target
- Creative hasn't fatigued (CTR stable)
- Conversion volume is consistent

---

## Budget Rules

### Testing (ABO)
- **Minimum per ad set:** $20-50/day
- **Testing duration:** 3-7 days minimum
- **Target:** 50+ conversions per ad set for learning

### Scaling (CBO)
- **Increase:** 10-20% every 2-3 days (conservative)
- **Aggressive:** 20-50% if CPA is 50%+ below target
- **Wait time:** 24-48 hours between increases
- **Reset trigger:** CPA increases 30%+ → pause increases

### Budget Allocation
| Funnel Stage | % of Budget |
|--------------|-------------|
| Prospecting (Broad) | 60-70% |
| Retargeting | 20-30% |
| Creative Testing | 10-20% |

## Emergency Reference

### Campaign Not Spending?
1. Check if in Learning Phase (need 50 conversions/week)
2. Increase budget (too low = no delivery)
3. Broaden audience (too narrow = limited reach)
4. Check for ad disapprovals
5. Verify payment method

### CPA Suddenly Spiked?
1. Check creative frequency (fatigue?)
2. Review recent changes (revert if needed)
3. Check for algorithm reset (learning limited)
4. Competitor activity (seasonal?)
5. Duplicate winning ad set fresh

### Account Disabled?
1. Request review immediately
2. Check all ads for policy violations
3. Review landing page compliance
4. Check payment status
5. Contact Meta support (Business Help Center)
