### Testing Velocity Benchmarks

**New Concept:** A fundamentally different creative approach
**Iteration:** A variation of a proven concept

```
Healthy Creative Pipeline:
├── 70% Iterations (variations of winners)
└── 30% New Concepts (big swings)
```

### Winner Rate Expectations

**Don't expect most creative to work.**

| Creative Quality | Expected Win Rate |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Untested concepts | 10-20% |
| Based on research | 20-30% |
| Iterations of winners | 30-50% |
| AI-optimized variations | 25-40% |

**Key Insight:** You need to test 5-10 concepts to find 1-2 winners.

## Iteration Process

### Winner Analysis Framework

When creative wins, ask:

1. **What hook did we use?**
   - What made people stop scrolling?
   - What question/statement worked?

2. **What emotion did we trigger?**
   - Fear? Desire? Curiosity?
   - How did visuals support this?

3. **What proof worked?**
   - Testimonial? Data? Authority?
   - What built trust?

4. **What format worked?**
   - Video vs static?
   - Length?
   - Aspect ratio?

5. **What audience responded?**
   - Age? Gender? Interest?
   - What does this tell us?

### Variation Creation

**Ways to Iterate a Winner:**

| Variation Type | What to Change |
|----------------|----------------|
| Hook swap | Same body, different hook |
| Visual swap | Same script, different creator/visuals |
| Format swap | Same message, different format (static→video) |
| Length swap | Same concept, shorter/longer |
| Offer swap | Same ad, different offer/CTA |
| Angle shift | Same product benefit, different angle |

### The Mashup Method

Combine elements from different winners:

```
Winner A: Great hook
Winner B: Great proof section
Winner C: Great CTA

New Creative = A's hook + B's proof + C's CTA
```

### Creative Refresh Timing

**When to Refresh:**
- CTR declining 20%+ week-over-week
- Frequency above 3.0 (prospecting) or 5.0 (retargeting)
- Creative running unchanged for 3+ weeks
- CPA rising despite stable CPM

**How to Refresh:**
1. Create 2-3 iterations of winning concept
2. Add to same ad set as original
3. Let algorithm choose winner
4. Pause original when new creative wins
