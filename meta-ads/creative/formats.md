## UGC (User Generated Content)

### What Makes Great UGC

**Authenticity Over Polish**
UGC works because it looks like content from a friend, not a brand.

| Polish Level | Perception |
|--------------|------------|
| Too polished | "This is an ad" → skepticism |
| Too rough | "This is unprofessional" → distrust |
| Sweet spot | "This is a real person's opinion" → trust |

### UGC Structures

**1. Problem-Solution**
```
Opening: "I used to struggle with [problem]"
Middle: "Then I found [product]"
Demo: Show product in use
Result: "Now I [outcome]"
CTA: "You should try it"
```

**2. Testimonial Review**
```
Opening: "Okay I have to tell you about [product]"
Middle: "I was skeptical but..."
Proof: Show results/product
Close: "Honestly, it's amazing"
```

Opening: "[Product] just arrived!"

```

**5. Tutorial/How-To**

### UGC Hooks That Work

```
"Okay I need to tell you about..."

"Why did nobody tell me about this sooner?"

"If you're like me and struggle with [problem]..."
"This is the best purchase I've made this year"
"I've been using [product] for [time] and..."

```

## Founder/Talking Head

### When Founder Content Wins

**Best For:**
- Building brand trust
- Explaining complex products
- B2B/SaaS (expertise matters)
- Differentiation (no competitor can copy your founder)
- Retargeting (deeper connection)

**Founder Content Works When:**
- Founder is authentic and relatable
- Product story is compelling
- Camera presence is decent (doesn't need to be perfect)
- Message matches founder's natural style

### Setup and Production

**Basic Setup (Budget):**
```
Camera: iPhone (4K mode)
Audio: Lav mic ($20-50) or AirPods Pro
Lighting: Natural window light or ring light ($30-50)
Background: Clean, uncluttered, or branded
```

**Better Setup:**
```
Camera: Sony ZV-1 or mirrorless
Audio: Rode Wireless Go II
Lighting: Key light + fill light
Background: Professional or office setting
```

**Best Setup:**
```
Camera: Professional video camera or cinema
Audio: Shotgun mic + boom
Lighting: Three-point setup
Background: Custom branded set
```

### Script Frameworks for Founder Videos

**Problem-Solution Framework:**
```
0-3s: "Are you still [pain point]?"
3-10s: "I was too. That's why I built [product]."
10-20s: "[Product] helps you [benefit] by [how]."
20-30s: "[Social proof or result]"
30-35s: "Try it free at [CTA]"
```

**Origin Story Framework:**
```
0-5s: "Three years ago, I was [frustrated situation]"
5-15s: "I tried everything: [list failed solutions]"
15-25s: "So I built [product] to [solve it properly]"
25-35s: "Now [X] people use it to [outcome]"
35-40s: "Join them at [CTA]"
```

**Myth-Busting Framework:**
```
0-3s: "Everyone thinks [common belief]. They're wrong."
3-15s: "The truth is [contrary reality]."
15-25s: "That's why [product] does [different approach]."
25-30s: "See for yourself: [CTA]"
```

### Authenticity vs Polish Balance

| Element | Authentic Approach | Over-Polished (Avoid) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Script | Bullet points, natural language | Word-for-word teleprompter |
| Delivery | Conversational, some stumbles OK | Robotic, overly rehearsed |
| Setting | Real office/workspace | Fake corporate set |
| Outfit | What you'd actually wear | Costume or over-dressed |
| Edits | Clean but not over-cut | Hollywood transitions |

### B-Roll Integration

**What B-Roll to Capture:**
- Product in use
- Screen recordings
- Team working
- Results/outcomes
- Customer interactions

**Integration Pattern:**
```
Talking head (3s) → B-roll (2s) → Talking head (3s) → B-roll (2s)...
```

## Static Images

### Image Styles That Work

**1. Lifestyle Photography**
- Product in real-life context
- Aspirational setting
- Target customer using product

**2. Product Hero Shots**
- Clean, focused on product
- Multiple angles
- Detail shots

**3. Graphic/Designed**
- Bold typography
- Clear value proposition
- Brand colors

**4. Screenshots/Data**
- Results dashboard
- Before/after metrics
- App interface

**5. Meme/Native Style**
- Looks organic to feed
- Humor or relatability
- Native text formatting

### Text Overlay Best Practices

**The 20% Rule:**
Meta used to penalize ads with >20% text. Now it's a guideline, but:
- More text = often lower delivery
- Key message should be in ~20% of image

**Text Hierarchy:**
```
1. HEADLINE (Large, Bold) ← Read first
2. Supporting text (Smaller)
3. CTA or offer (Contrast color)
```

**Readability Rules:**
- Minimum 24px on mobile
- High contrast (light text on dark or vice versa)
- Simple fonts (no cursive for key text)
- Max 2 font styles per image

### Before/After Images

**Effective Before/After:**
- Clear, honest transformation
- Same angle/lighting for comparison
- Minimal other changes
- Time frame mentioned

**Compliance Note:**
Before/after for weight loss, health, financial results may be restricted. Check Meta's policies.

### Comparison Images

**Us vs Them:**
```
[OLD WAY]          [YOUR WAY]
❌ Pain point       ✅ Solution
❌ Pain point       ✅ Solution
❌ Pain point       ✅ Solution
```

**Feature Comparison:**
```
          [US]    [THEM]
Feature 1   ✅       ❌
Feature 2   ✅       ⚠️
Feature 3   ✅       ✅
Price      $XX     $XXX
```

### Meme-Style Statics

**Why They Work:**
- Look like organic content
- High engagement (shares, comments)
- Low production cost
- Test messaging quickly

**Format:**
- Use popular meme templates
- Adapt to your product/audience
- Keep brand subtle or add logo

## Carousels

### When to Use Carousels

**Best For:**
- Multiple products
- Step-by-step processes
- Feature showcases
- Storytelling
- Portfolio/case studies

**Not Ideal For:**
- Single message
- Simple offers
- When you need quick impact

### Card Sequencing

**Optimal Card Count:** 3-5 cards (users rarely swipe past 5)

**Sequencing Options:**

**Option 1: Hook → Benefit → Benefit → Proof → CTA**
```
Card 1: Attention-grabbing hook image
Card 2: Benefit #1 explained
Card 3: Benefit #2 explained
Card 4: Social proof (testimonial, stats)
Card 5: CTA + offer
```

**Option 2: Problem → Solution → How → Results → CTA**
```
Card 1: Pain point (relatable image)
Card 2: Solution overview
Card 3: How it works
Card 4: Results achieved
Card 5: Get started CTA
```

**Option 3: Product showcase**
```
Card 1: Hero product shot
Card 2: Product detail/feature
Card 3: Product in use
Card 4: Customer review
Card 5: Shop now + price
```

### First Card Optimization

**First card must work standalone**
- Many users don't swipe
- First card can be shown as single image ad
- Make it compelling enough to stop scroll

**First Card Elements:**
- Strongest visual
- Clear hook text
- Reason to swipe ("See results →")

### Carousel Story Arc

**The Mini-Story Framework:**
```
Card 1: Setup (Introduce situation/problem)
Card 2: Conflict (Why it's hard/what fails)
Card 3: Solution (Your product appears)
Card 4: Resolution (Success achieved)
Card 5: Call to Action (Join/Buy/Learn)
```

## Video Formats

### Aspect Ratios by Placement

| Aspect Ratio | Best Placements | When to Use |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 9:16 (Vertical) | Stories, Reels | Mobile-first, highest engagement |
| 4:5 (Tall) | Feed | Good all-around mobile |
| 1:1 (Square) | Feed | Works everywhere |
| 16:9 (Landscape) | In-stream | Desktop, YouTube-style |

**Recommendation:** Create in 9:16, adapt to other ratios

### Length by Objective and Placement

| Placement | Awareness | Consideration | Conversion |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Feed | 15-30s | 30-60s | 15-30s |
| Stories | 15s | 15s | 15s |
| Reels | 15-30s | 15-30s | 15-30s |
| In-stream | 30-60s | 60-120s | 30-60s |

**General Rule:** Shorter is usually better. Get to the point.

### Caption/Subtitle Requirements

**80% watch without sound. Captions are mandatory.**

**Caption Styles:**
- Burned-in (permanent in video) — Recommended
- SRT files (Meta adds) — Backup option

**Caption Best Practices:**
- White or yellow text with black outline/shadow
- Large enough to read on mobile (minimum 5% of screen height)
- Placed in lower third but not covered by UI
- Match timing to speech

### Sound On vs Sound Off Optimization

**Sound-Off Optimization:**
- Captions for all speech
- Text overlays for key points
- Visual storytelling carries message
- Music optional

**Sound-On Enhancement:**
- Music sets mood/energy
- Sound effects for emphasis
- Voice tone builds connection
- Audio logo for brand recognition

**Best Practice:** Create for sound-off, enhance for sound-on

## AI-Generated Creative

### AI Tools for Ad Creative

**Image Generation:**
| Tool | Best For | Quality |
|------|----------|---------|
| Midjourney | Artistic, lifestyle | High |
| DALL-E 3 | Realistic, product | High |
| Adobe Firefly | Commercial use | High |
| Stable Diffusion | Flexibility, control | Variable |

**Video Generation:**
| Tool | Best For | Quality |
|------|----------|---------|
| Runway | Short clips, effects | High |
| Pika | Animation, style | Medium-High |
| Synthesia | Talking avatars | Medium |
| HeyGen | Avatar videos | Medium |

### What Works with AI Creative

**Good Use Cases:**
- Lifestyle backgrounds
- Product mockups
- Concept visualization
- B-roll and supplementary footage
- Thumbnail variations
- Quick iteration testing

**Poor Use Cases:**
- Replacing real testimonials (authenticity)
- Detailed product photography
- Founder/person content
- Anything requiring trust

### Legal Considerations

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- FTC requires disclosure of AI-generated endorsements
- Meta may require AI disclosure labels
- Check platform policies regularly

**Intellectual Property:**
- AI images may not be copyrightable
- Check tool's commercial use rights
- Avoid generating copyrighted characters/brands

### Hybrid Approaches

**Best Results: AI + Human**

```
AI generates background → Human overlays real product
AI creates concept art → Human refines and produces
AI writes variations → Human selects and edits
AI generates B-roll → Human edits with real footage
```

## Format Performance by Placement

### Meta's Placement-Format Matrix

| Format | Feed | Stories | Reels | Audience Network |
|--------|------|---------|-------|------------------|
| Single Image | ✅ Great | ✅ Great | ⚠️ OK | ✅ Great |
| Carousel | ✅ Great | ✅ Great | ❌ No | ⚠️ OK |
| Video | ✅ Great | ✅ Great | ✅ Great | ✅ Great |
| Collection | ✅ Great | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### Format Selection Guide

```
What do you want to communicate?
│
├── Single key message?
│   └── Single image or short video
│
├── Multiple features/products?
│   └── Carousel
│
├── Complex story or demonstration?
│   └── Video (30-60s)
│
├── Quick attention + action?
│   └── Short video (15s) or bold static
│
├── Product catalog browsing?
│   └── Collection or Dynamic Product Ads
│
└── Social proof/testimonials?
    └── UGC video or quote static
```

### Testing Format Hypothesis

**Don't Assume — Test**

```
Ad Set 1: Same message, Video format
Ad Set 2: Same message, Static image
Ad Set 3: Same message, Carousel

Run 5-7 days, compare:
- CPM (is one format cheaper?)
- CTR (is one more engaging?)
- CPA (is one converting better?)
```
