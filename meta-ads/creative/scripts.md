## Script Writing Tips

### Timing Guidelines

| Script Element | Ideal Duration |
|----------------|----------------|
| Hook | 2-5 seconds |
| Problem/Setup | 5-10 seconds |
| Solution/Demo | 10-20 seconds |
| Proof | 5-10 seconds |

### Pacing Notes

- **Fast paced:** Better for awareness, younger audience
- **Medium paced:** Good for most products
- **Slower paced:** Better for complex B2B, older audience

### Natural Speech Tips

1. Write how you talk, not how you write
2. Use contractions (don't, can't, it's)
3. Short sentences beat long ones
4. Include natural pauses and reactions
5. Bullet points for creator = more natural delivery

### CTA Best Practices

**Strong CTAs:**
- "Link in bio"
- "Tap below"
- "Get yours at [brand].com"
- "Try it free"
- "Click the link"

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Check it out if you want"
- "Maybe consider this"
- "If you're interested..."
