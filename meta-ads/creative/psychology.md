## How People Scroll

### The Feed Behavior Research

**Key Findings from Eye-Tracking Studies:**

- Average time on a piece of content: 1.7 seconds
- Decision to engage: made in 0.5-1 second
- 80%+ scroll without sound
- Thumb does ~90% of scrolling
- Most scroll with "F-pattern" or "Z-pattern" eyes

### The Three-Second Window

```
Second 0-1: "What is this?"
├── Visual registers
├── Brain categorizes (ad? content? friend?)
├── Initial interest/disinterest

Second 1-2: "Is this for me?"
├── Message absorption begins
├── Relevance assessment
├── Continue/skip decision forming

Second 2-3: "Should I stop?"
├── Hook payoff
├── Curiosity created (or not)
├── Scroll stops or continues
```

### Mobile-First Reality

**90%+ of Meta impressions are mobile**

**Implications:**
- Vertical formats (9:16, 4:5) perform better
- Text must be large and readable
- First 1-2 inches of screen are prime real estate
- Thumb zone = bottom-right corner (CTA placement)

### Sound-Off Default

**80% of feed video is watched without sound**

**Implications:**
- Captions are mandatory
- Visual storytelling must work silently
- Text overlays carry the message
- Music is bonus, not requirement

## Attention Science

### Pre-Attentive Processing

Your brain processes certain visual features BEFORE conscious attention:
- Color (especially red, yellow, contrast)
- Motion/movement
- Faces (especially eyes, emotions)
- Large shapes vs small
- Unexpected elements

**Use This:**
- High-contrast colors grab attention
- Motion in first frame captures eyes
- Faces create instant connection
- Size hierarchy guides attention

### Cognitive Load

**Lower cognitive load = Higher engagement**

| High Cognitive Load (Bad) | Low Cognitive Load (Good) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Dense text | Simple message |
| Multiple focal points | Single focal point |
| Complex visuals | Clean visuals |
| Industry jargon | Plain language |
| Many choices | One clear CTA |

### The Mere Exposure Effect

People prefer things they've seen before.

**Implications:**
- Consistent brand visuals build familiarity
- Retargeting works partly because of exposure
- Repetition creates comfort (but too much = annoyance)

### Novelty vs Familiarity Balance

**Too Familiar:** Ignored (looks like everything else)
**Too Novel:** Confusing (brain can't categorize)
**Sweet Spot:** Familiar enough to understand, novel enough to notice

## Pattern Interrupts

### What Is a Pattern Interrupt?

Something that breaks the expected visual pattern of a feed, forcing the brain to pay attention.

### Types of Pattern Interrupts

**1. Visual Contrast**
- Bright colors against feed's muted tones
- Black/white in a colorful feed
- Unusual shapes

**2. Motion Interrupt**
- Sudden movement at video start
- Hand waving
- Object flying into frame
- Abrupt transitions

**3. Text Interrupt**
- Large, bold text overlay
- Unusual fonts
- Text that poses a question
- Controversial statement

**4. Format Interrupt**
- Portrait in landscape-dominant feed
- Text-heavy in image-heavy feed
- Minimalist in busy feed

**5. Emotional Interrupt**
- Strong facial expression
- Surprising image
- Controversial visual

### Pattern Interrupt Examples

```
Hook: [HAND SLAPS TABLE]
"Stop scrolling. This is important."
→ Physical motion + direct address

Hook: [CLOSE-UP FACE, SHOCKED EXPRESSION]
"I can't believe this worked"
→ Emotional face + curiosity

Hook: [BOLD TEXT ON BLACK]
"EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT [TOPIC] IS WRONG"
→ Contrast + controversy

Hook: [PRODUCT FLYING INTO FRAME]
"This little thing changed my life"
→ Motion + intrigue
```

### Warning: Pattern Interrupt ≠ Clickbait

Pattern interrupt gets attention.
The content must DELIVER on the promise.

**Good:** Interrupt → Relevant content → Value → CTA
**Bad:** Interrupt → Bait and switch → User feels tricked

## Visual Hierarchy

### What Is Visual Hierarchy?

Organizing visual elements so viewers process information in the right order.

### The Priority Order

```
1. LARGEST/BOLDEST ELEMENT
   (What they see first)
   
2. Supporting visual
   (Context or proof)
   
3. Body text
   (Details if interested)
   
4. CTA
   (Action to take)
```

### Creating Hierarchy

**Size:** Bigger = More important
```
HEADLINE (Large)
Supporting text (Medium)
Fine print (Small)
```

**Color:** Contrast draws eyes
```
[BRIGHT CTA BUTTON] stands out from muted background
```

**Position:** Top-left reads first (for left-to-right languages)
```
Key message in top third
Supporting elements below
```

**Space:** Isolation creates importance
```
[     SINGLE MESSAGE     ]
     surrounded by space
     demands attention
```

### Mobile Visual Hierarchy

**Top Third (Premium Real Estate):**
- Hook text or key visual
- Must be compelling to stop scroll

**Middle Third:**
- Supporting information
- Social proof

**Bottom Third:**
- CTA
- Price/offer

### Common Hierarchy Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Everything same size | Nothing stands out | Create clear size difference |
| Too many focal points | Confusing | One primary focus |
| CTA buried | Missed conversions | Make CTA prominent |
| Text too small | Unreadable on mobile | Minimum 24px for key text |

## The Psychology of Persuasion

### Cialdini's Principles Applied to Ads

**1. Reciprocity**
Give value first, then ask.

```
Ad: "Free guide: 10 ways to [solve problem]"
Psychology: Viewer feels obligated to reciprocate attention
```

**2. Commitment/Consistency**
Get small yeses before big asks.

```
Ad: "Want better [outcome]? 👇 Comment YES"
Psychology: Public commitment increases follow-through
```

**3. Social Proof**
People follow the crowd.

```
Ad: "Join 10,000+ marketers who..."
Ad: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.9 from 2,000+ reviews"
Psychology: If others trust it, I should too
```

**4. Authority**
Experts are trusted.

```
Ad: "Dr. [Name] recommends..."
Ad: "Featured in Forbes, TechCrunch..."
Psychology: Authority figures reduce perceived risk
```

**5. Liking**
We buy from people we like.

```
Ad: Relatable founder story
Ad: UGC from someone "like me"
Psychology: Similarity and authenticity create connection
```

**6. Scarcity**
Limited availability increases desire.

```
Ad: "Only 47 spots left"
Ad: "Offer ends midnight"
Psychology: Fear of missing out motivates action
```

### Loss Aversion

**People feel losses 2x more than equivalent gains**

| Gain Frame (Weaker) | Loss Frame (Stronger) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Save $100" | "Stop losing $100/month" |
| "Get more leads" | "Stop missing leads" |
| "Improve your health" | "Don't let your health decline" |

### The Endowment Effect

People value things more once they "own" them.

**Application:**
- Free trials (they "own" the product)
- "Your free [thing] is waiting"
- Personalization ("Your custom plan")

## Emotional Triggers

### The Emotion Hierarchy

```
Strongest Motivators:
├── Fear (loss, missing out, danger)
├── Desire (aspiration, status, belonging)
└── Curiosity (mystery, incomplete information)

Medium Motivators:
├── Anger (injustice, frustration)
├── Surprise (unexpected, novelty)
└── Joy (pleasure, humor)

Weaker Motivators:
├── Trust (reliability, safety)
└── Anticipation (future reward)
```

### Fear-Based Hooks

Use carefully — powerful but can backfire if overused.

```
"Are you making this expensive mistake?"
"The hidden danger of [common practice]"
"What your [competitor/industry] doesn't want you to know"
"You're leaving $X on the table every month"
```

### Desire-Based Hooks

Aspirational messaging for positive motivation.

```
"What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
"The [product] that [successful people] use"
"Finally feel [desired emotion] about your [area]"
"Imagine waking up to [desired outcome]"
```

### Curiosity-Based Hooks

Information gaps that must be closed.

```
"I discovered this by accident..."
"The one thing [experts] won't tell you"
"Why does this simple trick work so well?"
"This changed everything for me (and it's not what you think)"
```

### Anger/Frustration Hooks

Channel existing frustration toward your solution.

```
"Tired of [common frustration]?"
"Why does [problem] have to be so hard?"
"We built this because we were fed up with [status quo]"
```

### Humor Hooks

Disarms, creates positive association, shares well.

```
"Me trying to [common struggle] [funny visual]"
"POV: You just discovered [product]"
"The face you make when [relatable situation]"
```

### Matching Emotion to Funnel Stage

| Funnel Stage | Best Emotions |
|--------------|---------------|
| Awareness | Curiosity, Surprise, Fear |
| Consideration | Desire, Trust, Social proof |
| Decision | Scarcity, Loss aversion, Urgency |

## Putting It Together

### The Scroll-Stopping Formula

```
1. PATTERN INTERRUPT (0-1 second)
   └── Motion, contrast, face, or text that breaks the scroll

2. HOOK (1-3 seconds)
   └── Curiosity, fear, or desire trigger
   └── "Is this for me?" answered YES

3. VALUE DELIVERY (3-10 seconds)
   └── Fulfill the hook promise
   └── Build understanding

4. PROOF (10-20 seconds)
   └── Social proof, results, testimonials
   └── "Can I trust this?"

5. CTA (Final moment)
   └── Clear, single action
   └── Lower perceived friction
```

### The Psychology Checklist

Before launching creative, ask:

- [ ] What pattern does this interrupt?
- [ ] What emotion does this trigger?
- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?
- [ ] Does this work without sound?
- [ ] Is cognitive load minimized?
- [ ] What persuasion principle is at work?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling for this?
