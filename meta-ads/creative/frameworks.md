### FAB (Feature-Advantage-Benefit)

For products where features matter (B2B, SaaS, technical).

**Structure:**
```
F - Feature: What it has/does
A - Advantage: Why that matters vs alternatives
B - Benefit: How it improves customer's life
```

**Example:**
```
FEATURE: 
"Real-time sync across all devices"

ADVANTAGE:
"Unlike [competitors] that sync hourly, 
your changes appear instantly everywhere"

BENEFIT:
"So you never lose work or waste time 
waiting for updates — work seamlessly 
from phone, tablet, or desktop"

not in an hour like other tools.

Work seamlessly from any device without 
ever losing progress or waiting.

### The "Us vs Them" Framework

Positioning against alternatives/competitors.

**Structure:**
```
1. Establish the "old way" (competitor/status quo)
2. Highlight its problems
3. Present the "new way" (your product)
4. Show the difference
```

**Example:**
```
OLD WAY:
"With traditional [category], you have to:
❌ [Pain point 1]
❌ [Pain point 2]
❌ [Pain point 3]"

"With [PRODUCT]:
✅ [Benefit 1]
✅ [Benefit 2]
✅ [Benefit 3]"

BRIDGE:
"Same outcome, zero hassle.

```

## Storytelling Frameworks

### Mini-Story Arc (30-60 second video)

**Structure:**
```
1. Setup (Character + Context) - 5-10s
2. Conflict (Problem arises) - 5-10s
3. Climax (Discovery of solution) - 5-10s
4. Resolution (Happy ending) - 5-10s
5. CTA (What viewer should do) - 5s
```

**Example:**
```
[SETUP] "Meet Sarah. She runs a marketing agency 
and was working 70-hour weeks."

[CONFLICT] "Client requests were piling up, 
deadlines were slipping, and she was burning out."

[CLIMAX] "Then she found [PRODUCT]."

[RESOLUTION] "Now her team handles twice the 
clients in half the time. Sarah's finally taking 
vacations again."

[CTA] "Ready to transform your workflow? 
Start free at [WEBSITE]."
```

**Structure:**
```
1. Before: Life before product
2. Trigger: What made them look for solution
3. Search: Alternatives they tried
4. Discovery: Finding your product
5. Experience: Using your product
6. After: Life now
```

**Example (Long-form video):**
```
[BEFORE]

for my coaching business."

nothing to show for it. I knew something

### Transformation Story

**Structure:**
