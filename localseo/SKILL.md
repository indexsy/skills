# Local SEO Audit Skill

## Quick Start

**To run a Local SEO audit, I need:**

1. **Business name** (exactly as it should appear)
2. **Address** (full)
3. **Phone number**
4. **Website URL**
5. **GBP link** (or I can find it)
6. **Top 3-5 services** they want to rank for
7. **Target city/area**

**Optional but helpful:**
- LocalRank.so credentials/API (for citation data + rank grids)
- Who they think their competitors are
- Any past moves/rebrands in last 2 years

---

## What I'll Do

- Fetch & analyze website (NAP, schema, location pages, technical)
- Check GBP completeness (publicly visible data)
- Search citation sites (Yelp, Facebook, Apple, Bing, etc.)
- Run competitor search for Map Pack
- Check rankings for target keywords
- Produce full audit with issue template (P0-P3)

## What I Can't Do (Needs Human Access)

- GBP admin changes
- Submit citation updates
- Respond to reviews
