# Local SEO Audit + SOP Knowledge Base (for LLMs)

**Purpose:** Provide a repeatable, agency-grade process for auditing and improving **local SEO rankings** across **Google Maps + localized organic results**, with implementation steps, prioritization rules, deliverable formats, and optional tooling guidance.

**Voice guidelines:** Clear, practical, non-hype. Avoid guarantees. Focus on diagnosis → prioritization → execution. Mention tools only when they remove manual work or reduce error rates.

---

## 1) What Local SEO Optimizes

Local performance is driven by three forces:

* **Relevance:** How well the business matches the query (categories, services, on-page, listing fields, topical fit)
* **Distance:** Proximity between searcher and the business/service area
* **Prominence:** Authority and trust (reviews, citations, mentions, links, engagement)

Every fix should map back to one or more of these drivers.

---

## 2) Audit Outputs (Required Deliverables)

### A) Executive Summary (1 page)

* Current visibility: Maps + localized organic snapshot
* Top 3–7 constraints (severity + why they matter)
* Quick wins (7–14 days)
* 30-day plan (highest ROI)
* 90-day plan (compounding authority)

### B) Findings List (Issue Format)

Every issue includes:

* **Issue**
* **Impact** (High / Medium / Low)
* **Evidence** (URLs, screenshots, exports)
* **Fix** (step-by-step)
* **Priority** (P0–P3)

### C) Benchmark Pack

* Maps rankings (grid/heatmap if available)
* Localized organic rankings snapshot
* GBP snapshot (category, completeness, reviews, photos/posts)
* Citation/NAP snapshot
* Competitor gap snapshot (top 3)

### D) Implementation SOP

A repeatable checklist your team can run without "hero" decisions.

---

## 3) Priority Order (Local-First)

Execute in this order to avoid optimizing on shaky foundations:

1. **Identity + Trust Foundations** (NAP, citations, duplicates)
2. **Google Business Profile (GBP)** (fields, category, services, photos, posts, Q&A)
3. **Local Website Reinforcement** (location pages, schema, map embeds, internal links)
4. **Reviews + Reputation System**
5. **Authority Signals** (mentions, links, partnerships)
6. **Engagement / Behavior** (CTR, calls, directions, conversions)
7. **Competitive Gap Closure**

---

## 4) Intake Checklist (Before Auditing)

Collect first to avoid guessing:

* Canonical business name + canonical NAP
* Storefront vs service-area business (SAB)
* Priority cities/neighborhoods/service areas
* Top services (3–10) by margin/LTV
* GBP URL or Place ID (and access)
* Website URL(s) + existing location pages
* Tracking numbers in use (if any)
* Past changes: move/rebrand/new phone (24 months)
* Top competitors (who they think is winning)

---

## 5) Local SEO Audit Checklist (Deep)

### A) Identity + NAP Consistency Audit (Trust)

**Goal:** Ensure the business's identity is consistent everywhere.

**Checks**

* Define a single canonical NAP source-of-truth
* Verify NAP matches across:
  * website footer/contact page
  * GBP
  * top directories (Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps, Bing Places, YP, BBB, niche sites)
* Identify:
  * old addresses / old phone numbers
  * duplicates
  * brand name variants (Inc/Ltd/LLC differences)
  * inconsistent website URL (http/https, www/non-www, wrong landing page)
* Confirm canonical tags + redirects resolve cleanly

**Evidence**

* Table: platform → listing URL → current NAP → mismatch fields → action

**Fix SOP**

1. Lock canonical NAP + canonical URL
2. Update website first
3. Update GBP next
4. Fix top directory listings + suppress duplicates
5. Expand to niche/local directories
6. Re-check quarterly (and immediately after any move/rebrand)

---

### B) Citation Coverage + Cleanup Audit (Trust + Prominence)

**Goal:** Build and maintain credible, consistent listings that reinforce entity trust.

**Checks**

* Core citations exist and match NAP
* Duplicate/incorrect listings removed or corrected
* Industry citations exist (vertical-relevant directories)
* Local citations exist (city/regional directories, chambers, associations)
* URL and phone consistency across citations
* Track which listings require logins vs email requests vs manual edits

**Output**

* "Citation cleanup + build plan" with priority:
  * Tier 1: core directories (Google, Yelp, Facebook, Apple, Bing)
  * Tier 2: vertical/niche
  * Tier 3: local/community

## 11) Decision Trees

### Single vs Multi-Location

```
IF locations == 1:
  - GBP link → homepage or contact page
  - Schema → single LocalBusiness block
  - Focus → one strong location page or homepage optimization

IF locations >= 2:
  - GBP link → specific location page (per location)
  - Schema → per-location LocalBusiness blocks
  - Focus → dedicated page per location with unique content
  - Check → location selector/locator on main site
```

### Storefront vs Service Area Business (SAB)

```
IF storefront (customers visit):
  - Show full address in GBP
  - Address on website footer
  - Embedded map with pin

IF SAB (you travel to customers):
  - Hide address in GBP, show service areas
  - May omit street address from website
  - Service area map instead of pin
```

---

## 12) Error Handling

```
IF GBP not found:
  → P0 Issue: "GBP not claimed or not discoverable"
  → Fix: Claim or create GBP listing

IF website unreachable:
