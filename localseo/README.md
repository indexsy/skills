## 🔧 Methodology

Based on the **3 Forces of Local SEO**:

1. **Relevance** — How well the business matches the query
2. **Distance** — Proximity to searcher
3. **Prominence** — Authority and trust signals

### Priority Order

1. Identity + Trust Foundations (NAP, citations)
2. Google Business Profile optimization
3. Local website reinforcement
4. Reviews + reputation system
5. Authority signals (mentions, links)
6. Competitive gap closure
